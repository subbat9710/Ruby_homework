# Ruby_homework
In this section I am trying to do the homework from ruby Hard Way book to practice more.
The use of #{3+2} in the code above is how you insert Ruby computations into text strings. You can put anything that is Ruby code between the { (left-bracket) and } (right-bracket) characters and Ruby will run it and put the result there instead of those characters. It may not make a lot of sense right now, but you will use this more and more in the book and begin to understand it as you work.
